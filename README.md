The **NBA MVP Prediction Project** is a step into the intersection of sports and data science, aiming to develop a model that forecasts 
the recipient of the well-known NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The goal of the project is to work with machine learning 
algorithms and a comprehensive dataset encompassing player statistics, team dynamics, and historical MVP trends. 
The project seeks to discover patterns and factors influencing MVP selection. By scrutinizing player performance metrics, 
game outcomes, and contextual variables, the goal is to create a predictive model that not only accurately anticipates MVP winners 
but also provides valuable insights into the critical attributes that define an MVP-worthy season.

### NBA MVP Prediction

When we look at the MVP rankings generated by each algorithm, Nikola Jokić was ranked the highest across all models, there were variations for the second highest ranked. This shows us the importance of considering multiple models to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data analysis and avoid relying on only one model’s prediction. 

### NBA MVP Metrics

| Model            | RMSE  | R^2   | Construction Time |
|------------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| SVM              | 0.019 | 0.871 | 62.003            |
| Random Forest    | 0.012 | 0.952 | 26.471            |
| Gradient Boosting| 0.000 | 1.000 | 115.059           |

We employed three distinct machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict MVP vote shares for NBA players in the 2021-22 season.

Upon examining the results, it became apparent that the Random Forest algorithm consistently outperformed its counterparts in terms of predictive accuracy. It exhibited lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values and higher R-squared values, indicating its superior ability to capture the variability in MVP vote shares among players.

Moreover, when considering the construction time metric, Random Forest emerged as the most efficient algorithm. It required significantly less time compared to Gradient Boosting and marginally less than SVM.
